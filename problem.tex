\chapter{Problem Statement}

As smartphone technology is on the boom. 
Most of the smartphone run on Android.
Android being an open sourced OS anybody can develop and publish.
Which is most vulnerable as there is no trust in the app developed and installed by the user.
Trust factor is high if the app is downloaded from Google Play Store.
Android device allow to install third party apps and also from unknown source.
There is a downfall to this feature that any body can install any Android app from any source.
There are many apps which can mimick the icon and name but acts very differently from the original app.
There are no mechanism for establishing trust other than the apps from Google Play Store.
Trust can be verified from the users.


\par One malware that has hit recently on the smartphone is ransomware.
More specifically the ransomwares target Android device.
Ransomware has started to hit smartphones in 2012 as a fake antivirus which demands for a ransom from the user.
Still there is no perfect solution for this type of malware in Android.

\par The issues that were looked upon in this project is :-
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to trust the apps downloaded from a sources other than Google Play Store.  
    \item How to find ransomwares from the trust information recieved from the users of the app.
\end{itemize}

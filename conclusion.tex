\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this report, we showed you how some elements can be crowd sourced from the device, running on Android, of registered user for detecting ransomware.
We showed the architecture for detecting ransomware.
Only the app level implementation was done, this can be integrated with the Android OS.
We implemented the crowdsourcing of ip address that each app connects and these are analysed to term it as ransomware.
As only analysing ip is not enough to term an app as a ransomware.

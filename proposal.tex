\chapter{Proposal}

Here, we propose a ransomware detection module, which can be included to the Android ROM. 
Function of this module is to get data from user, upload log data from the device, save the user data to the cloud and most particularly alerting the user if a ransomware is detected. 
This section gives an overview of what the system is, detailed explanation will be given in the following section.\\

When an app is installed it is sent to the cloud server.
At the installation time itself the user will be asked whether the app is to be installed in trusted or untrusted mode.
After that some questions will be asked to the user regarding the permissions.
If the user installs the app in trusted mode no more questions will be asked.
If the user installs the app in untrusted mode, questions will be asked periodically.
With the help of finding of the cloud server and all the answers recieved from the user, determione that it is a ransomware.
